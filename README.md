# Welcome to Questify 🎉

Questify is a node.js application that allows users to register and log in, and also allows them to create and manage their list of items. We use the express library for network traffic handling, cors for cross-origin requests, morgan for logging HTTP traffic, bcrypt for encrypting user passwords, passport-jwt for user authorization, and jsonwebtoken for generating authorization tokens. We also use the mongodb database to store user data and their items.

The frontend of the application can be found at https://questify-md.netlify.app/, and the frontend source code repository can be found at https://github.com/MichalDziuba/Questify.

Thank you for using Questify 🙏.
